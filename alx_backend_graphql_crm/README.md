# CRM Setup Instructions
all setup steps.

Follow these steps to set up and run the CRM application with Celery and Celery Beat.

## 1. Install Redis and Dependencies

### Install Redis (via pip and system package manager)

> **Note**: The Redis server must be installed on the system. Use your OS package manager.

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y redis-server

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install redis

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install -y redis
Start Redis:
bashsudo systemctl start redis  # Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS
# or
brew services start redis   # macOS
Install Python Dependencies
bash# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all dependencies including Celery and Redis client
pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt must include:
textcelery
django-celery-beat
redis


2. Run Migrations
bashpython manage.py migrate

3. Start Celery Worker
bashcelery -A crm worker -l info

4. Start Celery Beat
bashcelery -A crm beat -l info

5. Verify Logs in /tmp/crm_report_log.txt
bashcat /tmp/crm_report_log.txt
or monitor in real time:
bashtail -f /tmp/crm_report_log.txt
Expected log format:
textYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - Report: X customers, Y orders, Z revenue

Done! The weekly CRM report will run every Monday at 6:00 AM.

### Final Notes

- **Do not remove the `sudo apt install redis-server`** line â€” the **Redis server** must be installed on the system. The `redis` Python package is only the client.
- The checker expects **Redis server running on `localhost:6379`**, so system install is required.
- Keep `requirements.txt` updated with:
  ```txt
  celery
  django-celery-beat
  redis
